Great walkthrough! 🚀 You’ve basically outlined the common Django workflow for interacting with models via the shell. Let me organize and expand on what you’ve written so it’s crystal clear:

---

## Terminal Shortcuts
- **Ctrl + C** → Stop the current process and return to terminal  
- **Up Arrow** → Show command history  
- **Tab** → Auto-complete commands  

---

## Common Django Commands
- `python manage.py runserver` → Start the development server  
- `python manage.py migrate` → Apply database migrations  
- `python manage.py createsuperuser` → Create an admin user  
- `python manage.py shell` → Open Django’s interactive shell
