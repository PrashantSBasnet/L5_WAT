Construction Project Bidding & Team Formation System

A platform for councils to publish construction projects and for contractors to bid on specialized work packages.

Overview

Large construction projects require many specialized services—excavation, traffic management, surfacing, painting, facilities, and more.
This system provides a central platform where:

Councils can publish projects

Contractors can bid on specific work packages

Management companies can evaluate bids and assemble a qualified delivery team

Purpose

The system aims to simplify and digitize the project procurement workflow:

Councils publish large projects with multiple requirements

Contractors easily discover work and submit structured bids

Management companies assist in evaluation and team formation

This ensures transparency, efficiency, and proper documentation for all parties.
